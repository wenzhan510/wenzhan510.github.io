      <description>Today is my digital detox day.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to turn of all my remote communication methods related to SOSAD.FUN, and have a good sleep, and eat well, and exercise, and be myself.

I don&amp;rsquo;t usually do this.
I made this decision 13h ago. It was 9am. I have not slept for another day or so. It was my typical day.
Suddenly, I felt my heart. By felt, I mean, I reasoned that something must have had went wrong with my heart.</description>

I had a dream last night.
I was at highschool, required to find a local community service to contribute to. My dad used his network and drove me and some other classmates to my hometown where we did some sort of measurement of landscapes (which of course won&amp;rsquo;t be used by anyone). After that, each of us had a little booklet style certificate, where the task and a score was recorded.</description>
