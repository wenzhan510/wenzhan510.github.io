      <description>Today is my digital detox day.
I&amp;rsquo;m going to turn of all my remote communication methods related to SOSAD.FUN, and have a good sleep, and eat well, and exercise, and be myself.

I don&amp;rsquo;t usually do this.
I made this decision 13h ago. It was 9am. I have not slept for another day or so. It was my typical day.
Suddenly, I felt my heart. By felt, I mean, I reasoned that something must have had went wrong with my heart.</description>
