  <p>Today is my <code>digital detox</code> day.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to turn of all my remote communication methods related to SOSAD.FUN, and have a good sleep, and eat well, and exercise, and be myself.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t usually do this.</p>
<p>I made this decision 13h ago. It was 9am. I have not slept for another day or so. It was my typical day.</p>
<p>Suddenly, I felt my heart. By felt, I mean, I reasoned that something must have had went wrong with my heart. One never feel one&rsquo;s body, unless part of it went wrong.</p>
<p>I panicked for a moment, and decided to detox myself from this website stuff.</p>
<p>I turned off all my remote communication where people can reach out to me for immediate help.</p>
<p>I had a 12h long sleep.</p>
<p>I woke up. The first thing I wanted to do was to reach out for my phone and check for messages. It was by that time I realized that, though the website related absolute work hours were not that much, it was a 24/7 on call position and qualifies to 2 full time jobs in the past 3 years.</p>
<p>I measured my blood pressure (I did not dare to do the measuring before this sleep). My DIA jumped to 92. The second time in a row this week that I had my DIA blood pressure above 90. One of my friend once joked about it: &ldquo;Are you like my dad now? He is in his sixies and his doctor gave him medicine to prevent him from having blood pressure above 90.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After digital detox for 13 hours, I realized how much I have been worn out.</p>
<p>For something that does not even cover my medical insurance, I guess that does not worth giving away my health with.</p>
